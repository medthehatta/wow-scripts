class Requester:
    """
    `Requester` provides a thin layer around the vanilla requests library.

    This provides three pieces of convenient functionality:

    1. Remembers the base URL so you don't need to keep passing it around.
    2. Authenticates using a `domino_pytk.authentication.AccessToken`, so
       requests will all use constantly refreshing credentials.
    3. Remembers miscellaneous extra headers (example: headers which disable
       CSRF) that are used in all the requests.

    Instead of providing separate methods for GET/POST/etc. , it provides a
    single `request` method which accepts the HTTP method name as a string.

    Using a single `request` method reduces duplication in client code because
    differences between calls to HTTP methods are generally small, and often
    the method name is the only difference.  (For example, PUT vs POST vs PATCH
    are generally interchangeable except for the method name.)  Therefore
    parametrizing the method with a string encourages code reuse without
    needing a bunch of `if` statements or separate methods in the client code
    to decide which method to call here.

# Handling responses

class ResponseHandler:
    """
    We collect common means of dealing with HTTP responses in these
    `ResponseHandler` classes.

    By collecting standard behaviors for HTTP responses in one place we gain a
    few advantages:

    1. We reduce boilerplate in client code.
    2. We facilitate parametrization of response behaviors.

    This is implemented in an OOP way with objects that have a single method so
    we can swap behavior by directly swapping the instance (and not modifying
    any invocations).  In most cases the handling requires no configuration --
    or there are obvious defaults -- so those cases are collected in a single
    convenient interface: `DefaultHandlers`.

    If you add a new kind of `ResponseHandler` and it has no configuration or
    reasonable default configuration, consider adding a convenience method to
    `DefaultHandlers`.

    An example of a `ResponseHandler` which WOULD require configuration might
    be one which logs the responses to a file and needs to be told where the
    file should go.

    Another example is `TracingResponseHandler`, implemented in this module.

    If the response handler has side-effects, consider putting the side-effects
    in their own handler and returning the response itself.  That way, we can
    apply multiple side-effects if desired by composing the functions.
    `TracingResponseHandler` does this, for example.
